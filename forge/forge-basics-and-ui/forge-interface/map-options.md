# Map Options

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/cover-map-options.jpg" alt="Cover image"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Map Options tab is the fourth tab at the top of the Forge Menu and it displays options such as changing map lighting, wind, sound, and inspecting budget usage.

## Interface

The Map Options tab consists of categories and subcategories, within which are adjustable map options and settings. The categories can be opened and closed, and their state will persist until the Forge session is closed. A short description of the selected item is shown under the main interface. The common adjustable map options include Sunlight, Light Bounce, Ambient Sound, Budget, and Level Bound Probes.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Atmospheric Fog Inscattering](map-options.md#inscattering) value must be under 1.00 for the color to show.
{% endhint %}



### Volumetric Fog

Volumetric fog settings simulate 3D fog as cost from a light source. For more details, see [Fog](../../lighting/settings-global-lighting/fog.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Volumetric Fog can be turned off client-side from the video settings, so it shouldn't be relied on for major fog effects.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Having global Screen Effects _on_ may cause issues on maps with multiple [FX-emitting objects](../../lighting/fx/fx-emitting-objects.md) such as [Weapon Spawners](../../gameplay/sandbox/weapons/weapon-spawning/). Turning the Screen Effects off in these cases helps prevent issues with FX overload.
{% endhint %}



## Decorators

#### Enabled

Toggles the visibility of decorators in the map. Decorators are small foliage details on the built-in canvas floor of Forge canvases.

{% hint style="info" %}
Decorators are usually disabled, as many maps aren't built directly on the canvas floor to visually benefit from them, and the performance impact of having them enabled is unknown.
{% endhint %}



## Ambient Sound

Ambient Sounds are audio loops heard throughout the map at a quiet volume.

#### Primary Sound

The primary ambient sound that plays in the map.

<details>

<summary>Input options:</summary>

\<default>

AA Gun Control Room

Banished Room

Cathedral

Distant City Busy

Distant City Quiet

Generator Room

Grasslands Active Wind

Grasslands Calm Wind

Prison Base

Prison Security Room

Scorched Earth

<details>

<summary>Input options:</summary>

\<none>

Distant Battle A

Distant Battle B

Distant Thunder

Lake Water Laps

Ocean Surf

Rain Heavy

Rain Light

Rain Medium

Thunder Storm with Rain

Wind Storm

</details>

#### Reverb

The type of reverb applied to the map. Reverb can be commonly heard in the form of object impacts, gunshots and explosions.

<details>

<summary>Input options:</summary>

Exterior Open

Exterior Reflective

Interior Large

Interior Medium

Interior Narrow

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
Reverb is a commonly overlooked option, but can help in making the map feel more realistic. Set the Reverb type based on the majority of place spaces in the map.
{% endhint %}

#### Audio Effect

The secondary ambient sound that plays in the map.

<details>

<summary>Input options:</summary>

\<none>

Helium

Space

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting an Audio Effect on a map is uncommon, as not many maps suit the theme, but they also affect all of the announcer voice lines, which sound weird.
{% endhint %}

#### Enable Preview

Toggles the playing of primary and secondary ambient sounds during Forge edit mode.



## Budget

Object placement limits and the current costs of various elements in the map. The budgets show a progress bar of how much of a specific budget has been used up. If a budget reaches 80%, a yellow warning icon shows up in the Map Options tab. If a budget reaches 100%, its progress bar turns red and a red warning icon shows up in the Map Options tab.

<div><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/map-options-forge-simulation-80.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Budget progress bar</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/map-options-forge-simulation-100.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Progress bar turns red at 100%</p></figcaption></figure></div>

<div><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/map-options-budget-80-warning.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Yellow warning symbol indicating a budget is at 80%</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/map-options-budget-100-warning.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Red warning symbol indicating a budget is at 100%</p></figcaption></figure></div>

#### Game Simulation

The cost of simulating entities in a networked environment, including dynamic objects, projectiles, units, actions, etc. This is separate from the additional cost of networking entities in Forge.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

The Game Simulation budget is the hard limit on what a map can simulate in gameplay. Dynamic objects and large scripts take up the majority of Game Simulation budget.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Game Simulation budget is also shown on the [Budget Meter](./#budget-meter) in the standard Forge interface.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Game Simulation budget used by Forge Modes via Mode Brains are separate from the on-level budgets. Even maps at 95% Game Simulation can be loaded with a Forge Mode that by itself takes up over 5% Game Simulation budget.
{% endhint %}

#### Forge Simulation

The cost of simulating entities in Forge, including dynamic and static objects, prefabs, user strings, Node Graph elements, etc. This is separate from the base cost of simulating entities in a networked environment.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

Forge Simulation often reaches 100.00% before Game Simulation, as the interfaces for modifying objects and elements in Forge require additional resources. One way to alleviate Forge Simulation budget is to convert on-level scripts from Script Brains into a Forge Mode script within Mode Brains.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Forge Simulation budget used by Forge Modes via Mode Brains are separate from the on-level budgets. It's best practice to load as much scripting from a Forge Mode, instead of from on-level scripting in order to relieve Game- and Forge Simulation budget to use on the map.
{% endhint %}



### Forge Simulation Detail

A breakdown of the categories of the Forge Simulation budget.

#### Objects

The total percent of the Forge Simulation budget used by Object entities, including static objects and dynamic objects.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

#### Node Graph

The total percent of the Forge Simulation budget used by Node Graph entities, including nodes, connections, and node properties.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

{% hint style="warning" %}
While the budget range is up to 100.00%, players have reported not being able to load map versions with Node Graph budget in the range of 14-20%. This real limit is affected by the amount of other objects on the map, but 14-20% should be considered the 100% of the Node Graph budget on full maps.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Node Graph budget used by Forge Modes via Mode Brains are separate from the on-level budgets. It's best practice to load as much scripting from a Forge Mode, instead of on-level scripting to not run into limitations with the Node Graph budget.
{% endhint %}

#### Misc

The total percent of the Forge Simulation budget used by miscellaneous entities, including prefabs, user strings, some properties, etc.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

{% hint style="info" %}
[Prefabs](../../../ugc/metadata-and-file-management/prefabs/) and [Folder](folders/) names take up Forge Simulation budget, but the impact is negligible to take into consideration. If the Forge Simulation budget is at 100.00%, you may not be able to create prefabs or rename folders.
{% endhint %}



### Object Limits

Object count limits for various types of objects.

#### Static Geo

The percentage usage of the static render meshes in the map. Static objects can be composed of multiple render meshes. This is a hard limit and cannot be exceeded.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

#### Vehicles

The number of vehicles in the map. Does not account for vehicles created during gameplay. Includes all types of [Vehicle Spawners](../../gameplay/sandbox/vehicles/vehicle-spawning/).

Budget range: `0` - `40` / 40

While the limit is only 40, it's a very safe limit, as the real hard limit for vehicles is 128. Some vehicles like the Scorpion and Warthog are made out of two vehicles: the mover and the turret. Creating vehicles during gameplay such as spawning players in vehicles or cloning vehicles via scripting only has the hard limit of 128 total vehicles in play.

{% hint style="info" %}
Attempting to create more than 128 vehicles won't work. If a vehicle made from two vehicles is created as the 128th vehicle, only the mover part of the vehicle will be created.
{% endhint %}

#### Reflection Volumes

The number of [Reflection Volumes](../../lighting/lighting-modifiers/reflections/reflection-volumes/) in the map. This is a hard limit and cannot be exceeded.

Budget range: `0` - `15` / 15

#### Movers

The number of movers in the map. This is a hard limit and cannot be exceeded.

Budget range: `0` - `48` / 48

{% hint style="info" %}
Only one object is known to fall into this category, being the _Vehicle Lift_ [hidden object](../../../guides-and-knowledge/forge-know-how/forge-misc/hidden-forge-objects.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Animations

The percentage usage of animation states used by objects in the map. This is a hard limit and cannot be exceeded.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

{% hint style="success" %}
Never reported as being the cause of issues.
{% endhint %}

#### Physics

The percentage usage of the total Physics budget. This is a soft limit and can be exceeded, but doing so may have a negative impact on performance, and some objects may stop working correctly.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

{% hint style="success" %}
Never reported as being the cause of issues.
{% endhint %}

#### Collision

The percentage usage of the total Collision budget. This is a soft limit and can be exceeded, but doing so may have a negative impact on performance, and some objects may stop working correctly.

Budget range: `0.0%` - `100.00%`

{% hint style="success" %}
Never reported as being the cause of issues.
{% endhint %}



## Level Bound Probes

Settings to adjust the light probes generated by default in a map. For details on what light probes are, see [Light Probes](../../lighting/lighting-modifiers/light-probes.md).

#### Bounding Type

The bounding type determines the area where to generate light probes by default. For details about custom light probes, see [Light Probe Marker](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

<details>

<summary>Input options:</summary>

Level

Objects

</details>

* **Level**: Light Probes are generated within the entire Forge canvas gameplay space. Only useful in maps with large skyboxes in the canvas gameplay space that need light bounce data.
* **Objects**: Light Probes are generated only within a bounding box that covers all objects placed in the map. Useful in maps built in interiors, or maps where the skybox doesn't need to have accurate light bounce data.

{% hint style="info" %}
While _Level_ is the default option, _Objects_ is usually recommended, as it often results in using less Light Probes, with the drawback of not having any light probes outside the invisible bounding box surrounding all placed objects.
{% endhint %}

#### Probe Spacing

Sets the distance between default light probes. For details about custom light probes, see [Light Probe Marker](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. Lower spacing values result in more accurate lighting at the expense of increased light probe counts and [lighting build](../../lighting/building-lighting/) times.

Input range: `1.00` - `100.00`

{% hint style="info" %}
A general good spacing to start with is 20, which can be decreased later to suit the desired lighting accuracy.
{% endhint %}

#### Probe Count

Estimated number of light probes based on the current settings across the Level Bound Probes and the [Light Probe Marker](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. Larger probe count values result in more accurate lighting at the expense of increased [lighting build](../../lighting/building-lighting/) times.

Value range: `0` - `14000` / 14000



## Reset

#### Reset Map Properties

Reset all map properties, such as fog, and reference colors to the default values as dictated by the Forge canvas base map.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This action cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

#### Delete All Unlocked

Delete all unlocked objects in the map. For more details about locked and unlocked objects, see [Lock & Unlock](folders/#lock-and-unlock).

{% hint style="danger" %}
This action cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}
