# AI Droppod Spawner

Spawns an AI unit using a Banished droppod. The object boundary must intersect the nav mesh, to see the Nav Mesh data toggle the _Nav Mesh Visualization_ to ON in the **Tool Settings** menu. Up to 32 AI units can exist at a time, but runtime budgets may decrease this limit.

## Remarks

Once the AI unit has exited the pod, it will overload and destroy itself. If an object obstructs the entry path of the droppod, it will phase through it and deliver the AI unit to where it intersects with the nav mesh.
