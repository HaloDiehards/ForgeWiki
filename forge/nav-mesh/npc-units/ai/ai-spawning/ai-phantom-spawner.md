# AI Phantom Spawner

Spawns AI units by dropping them from a Phantom. The object boundary must intersect the nav mesh, to see the Nav Mesh data toggle the _Nav Mesh Visualization_ to ON in the **Tool Settings** menu. Up to 32 AI units and 4 Phantoms can exist at a time, but runtime budgets may decrease this limit.

## Remarks

As the Phantom travels to the spawn location, it can be damaged and destroyed, preventing the AI units from entering gameplay. Objects obstructing the Phantom drop off location or path can interfere with the spawn process so it is important to verify that the dropship can reach its destination as expected.
