# AI Spawner

## AI Spawner

Spawns AI units. The object boundary must intersect the nav mesh, to see the Nav Mesh data toggle the _Nav Mesh Visualization_ to ON in the **Tool Settings** menu. Up to 32 AI units and 4 Phantoms can exist at a time, but runtime budgets may decrease this limit.

## Remarks

This is comparable to the spawning of a player in how the units are produced.
