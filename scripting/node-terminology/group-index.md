# Group Index
Group Index is used by game modes to determine priority when selecting objects, with lower numbers having higher priority.

## Firefight Group Indexes
In the Firefight Game Mode, Group Indexes are set in AI Spawner properties, and are used to determine which "hill" AI from a spawner will go to in Firefight KotH. Nodes in the Game Mode Firefight category can use Group Index to filter spawners and units.

## Firefight Subgroup Indexes
Subgroup Indexes are used to further define priority from within an Index Group.
